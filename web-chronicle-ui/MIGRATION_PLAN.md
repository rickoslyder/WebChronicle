# WebChronicle UI Migration Plan

## Overview
Migrating from vanilla JavaScript to Next.js 15 with React 19, TanStack Query v5, Zustand v5, and Tailwind CSS v4.

## Progress Tracker

### Phase 1: Project Setup ‚úÖ
- [x] Create Next.js 15 project with TypeScript
- [x] Install core dependencies (React Query, Zustand, Recharts, etc.)
- [x] Set up project directory structure
- [x] Create TypeScript type definitions
- [x] Create API client with TypeScript interfaces
- [x] Configure environment variables
- [ ] Set up development scripts

**Notes/Learnings:**
- Next.js 15 uses React 19 RC by default
- Tailwind v4 has zero configuration by default
- TypeScript plugin already configured in tsconfig.json
- Environment variables configured in constants.ts using process.env

---

### Phase 2: Core Architecture Setup ‚úÖ
- [x] Configure TanStack Query v5 provider with SSR support
- [x] Implement Zustand v5 stores with per-request isolation
- [x] Set up root layout with providers
- [x] Create custom hooks for data fetching
- [ ] Implement error boundaries
- [x] Set up loading states with Suspense

**Notes/Learnings:**
- TanStack Query v5 uses new streaming hydration approach
- Zustand v5 requires factory pattern for SSR compatibility
- Per-request store isolation prevents state leakage between requests
- Custom hooks created for all major data fetching operations

---

### Phase 3: Component Migration ‚úÖ
- [x] Build Navigation component
- [x] Create ActivityCard component with lazy-loaded summaries
- [x] Implement SearchBar with debouncing
- [x] Create Filter components:
  - [x] DateFilter with calendar UI
  - [x] DomainFilter with multi-select
  - [x] TagFilter with tag cloud
- [x] Build Settings modal
- [x] Create reusable UI components

**Notes/Learnings:**
- Used react-intersection-observer for infinite scroll
- Implemented debouncing with lodash.debounce for search
- Filter components use Zustand store for state management
- ActivityCard uses React Query for lazy-loading summaries

---

### Phase 4: Page Implementation ‚úÖ
- [x] Home/Timeline page with infinite scroll
- [x] Search page with semantic search
- [x] Analytics dashboard with Recharts
- [x] Settings page with persistence
- [ ] 404 and error pages

**Notes/Learnings:**
- Timeline uses infinite queries with intersection observer
- Search page implements debounced search with score display
- Analytics computes metrics client-side from activity data
- Settings page includes theme switcher and import/export

---

### Phase 5: Feature Enhancements ‚úÖ
- [x] Implement infinite scroll for timeline
- [x] Add real-time search with debouncing
- [x] Create analytics visualizations
- [x] Add data export functionality
- [x] Implement auto-refresh capability
- [x] Add dark mode support

**Notes/Learnings:**
- Infinite scroll implemented with react-intersection-observer
- Search debouncing uses lodash.debounce with 300ms delay
- Analytics uses Recharts for all visualizations
- Export functionality exports settings as JSON
- Auto-refresh dispatches custom events for refetching
- Dark mode controlled via theme setting in Zustand store

---

### Phase 6: Browser Rendering Integration üñºÔ∏è
- [ ] Screenshot preview on hover
- [ ] PDF export for activities
- [ ] Content extraction features
- [ ] Thumbnail generation

**Notes/Learnings:**
- 

---

### Phase 7: Performance Optimization ‚ö°
- [ ] Implement code splitting
- [ ] Add image optimization
- [ ] Configure caching strategies
- [ ] Implement virtual scrolling
- [ ] Add service worker for offline support

**Notes/Learnings:**
- 

---

### Phase 8: Testing & Quality üß™
- [ ] Add TypeScript strict checks
- [ ] Implement unit tests
- [ ] Add E2E tests with Playwright
- [ ] Performance testing
- [ ] Accessibility audit

**Notes/Learnings:**
- 

---

### Phase 9: Deployment üöÄ
- [ ] Configure production build
- [ ] Set up Cloudflare Workers deployment
- [ ] Configure environment variables
- [ ] Set up CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Deploy to production
- [ ] Monitor and optimize

**Notes/Learnings:**

## Key Decisions & Rationale

### Architecture Decisions
1. **App Router over Pages Router**: Better performance with React Server Components
2. **TanStack Query for data fetching**: Superior caching and synchronization
3. **Zustand for state management**: Simpler than Redux, perfect for our needs
4. **Tailwind CSS v4**: Zero config, better performance

### Technical Choices
1. **TypeScript strict mode**: Better type safety and developer experience
2. **React 19 features**: Form actions, use() hook, improved hydration
3. **Streaming SSR**: Better perceived performance
4. **CSS-in-CSS**: Using Tailwind's new CSS-first configuration

## Migration Strategy

1. **Parallel Development**: Keep vanilla JS version running while building React version
2. **Feature Parity First**: Match existing functionality before adding new features
3. **Incremental Migration**: One component/feature at a time
4. **Testing at Each Step**: Ensure nothing breaks during migration

## Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge 1: Hydration Mismatches
**Solution**: Using proper hydration boundaries and client-only components where needed

### Challenge 2: Dynamic Content Loading
**Solution**: React Query with proper caching and infinite queries

### Challenge 3: State Management Complexity
**Solution**: Zustand with per-request stores for SSR compatibility

## Performance Metrics to Track

- [ ] Initial page load time
- [ ] Time to interactive
- [ ] Search response time
- [ ] Memory usage with large datasets
- [ ] Bundle size

## Post-Migration Improvements

1. **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket integration for live activity updates
2. **Advanced Analytics**: More detailed insights and visualizations
3. **AI Features**: Smart categorization and insights
4. **Collaboration**: Share activity collections
5. **Mobile App**: React Native companion app
